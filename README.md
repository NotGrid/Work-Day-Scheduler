## Overview

### The challenge

The goal of this asssignment I to utilize moment.js and jquery to create a work-based day planner.

### User Story
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## My process

I first focused on creating the layout of the day planner as well as adding the proper links for Jquery and moment.js.  Once I was satisfied with the page, I created the Jquery code to bring functionality to the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Jquery
- Bootstrap



### What I learned

I learned the importance of link placement within the HTML. I had to move links around the head and body tags to keep my code from breaking.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php) - This helped me understand how to implement and alter bootstrap in my code.
or anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
